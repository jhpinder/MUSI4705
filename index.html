<h2>MAX/MSP Communication and Sounds:</h2>
<p>The general purpose of the MAX MSP section of this project is to take the data from the Arduino and convert that data into a sound that is played through Ableton Live. The MAX patch takes serial data from the Arduino that has been generated by Jared’s code for note pitch, duration, tempo, and a control value that the MAX patch converts into MIDI values. There are two main sections of the MAX patch: the section that takes serial values and converts them into MIDI and the section that allows control mapping of MIDI parameters in Ableton Live devices in MAX MSP. The Ableton Live track is set up with this MAX patch and an Instrument Rack device with five instrument VST’s currently inside to provide a range of sounds including piano, electric guitar, synth, Rhodes piano, banjo, and potentially more. The current instrument being played is determined by the control value retrieved from the Arduino. The MIDI mapping portion of the MAX MSP code is mapped to the Chain Selector parameter in the Instrument Rack device. The Chain Selector selects between the five instruments determined by the control value retrieved from Arduino (0-4). The other MIDI values retrieved from the Arduino that regard pitch, tempo, and duration are routed into the selected instrument in the Instrument Rack and, like other MIDI devices, are played live through the computer’s speakers. </p>
<h2>Enclosure Construction:</h2>
<p>	This section covers a brief overview of the construction of the physical object. This version is made entirely of ½-inch MDF wood. We chose between plywood and MDF for our prototype due to their cheap and abundant nature; as well they are easily worked with using the tools we had available to us. Ultimately we went with the ½-inch MDF as it was the most cost effective material and its soft, easily manipulated structure for small construction processes. Our choice of material did influence our design in that based on the material available and used would determine our ability to create it. For example, if we had gone with a metal, we would have had to find a way to manipulate it without welding as we had no access to a welding torch. However, since a soft wood was chosen, we could go with something more complex and made up of multiple pieces. Since the crux of our project relies on “stacking” or “building” chords, we needed a compartmental, sectional design. As such, a design similar to that of a fishing “tackle box” was decided on as its basic structure is separate boxes for separate lures and baits. For us, we could modify this design as it is seen now: Eight separate columns each with their own set of one root note “box” and three third note “boxes.”</p>
<p>Once we had a final design idea, we had to mock-up how we could create this partitioned box from the MDF. A five-faced, open top box seemed the most logical as it offered a stable structure while allowing for a place for our note blocks without having to add a lifting top or any such surface. These five faces were simply made of the MDF wood and nailed together with decking screws to create the shell of the box. The inside is where it got more complicated. We wanted to make equally partitioned spaces for third blocks and root blocks, however we wanted to spaces for root blocks to be visually different from the third blocks as to make a visual representation of their importance. This was achieved in the form of the root note blocks being larger than the third blocks, meaning the spaces for the root note had to be larger than the third notes. As our box was to be an eight column by 4 row grid, we now had to create one row larger than the others while keeping the other three the same. Ultimately we created our grid by creating an interlocking, modular “lattice” of MDF strips. These strips were created with a table saw and a custom jig, a “pattern” for a specific width and height you want cut from a piece of wood. Finally, we simply placed this lattice inside the box to achieve the “tackle box” look we were going for. The last step in construction was to drill holes inside of the lattice so that wires from each column could remain partitioned off from other columns, but ultimately meet so they would be connected to the other rows. This was done be drilling holes into each column from the top down, but then extra holes across the width of the board on the lowest row. This was done to give the wires one singular path from the board, to the Arduino.</p>

<h2>3D Modeling/Printing:</h2>
<p>The 3D modeling for the entire project was done in SketchUp. Since it doesn't
have a native .stl export function, an extension that allowed SketchUp to export
.stl files was downloaded and installed.</p>
<p>To begin the process of modeling the required pieces, we first needed to
create a model of the wood box and divider grid. This allowed us to design the
pieces around the actual dimensions of the box before the entire box was
complete. The first draft of the box is shown in the image below:</p>

<p>After modeling the box with the grid inside, the next step was to design a 3d model that would allow the switches to be positioned facing up. The switches we selected had two mounting holes in the sides, so a model was designed to secure them in place using the holes. Two switches per block were required to detect three different states: no block, major third, and minor third. Both switches were aligned on the same side of each grid space. Depending on which way the block is placed on top of the switches, it will either trigger one switch or the other. Each switch requires around 2.5oz to actuate, and only one switch would be actuated at a time, so weights were installed in the third blocks to ensure actuation every single time. Six weights each weighing 0.5oz were installed in each block to bring the total weight up to over 2.5oz with some to spare, as shown in the image below:</p>

<p>To select the bass note for each chord, larger blocks are placed on the bottom row of each column. Instead of using switches to detect the different bass blocks, we used different values of resistors and assigned different notes to their corresponding values. Copper tape was secured on the bottom of each bass block as well as the spaces where the bass blocks are placed. Below is an image of the 3d model of the bass note block holder:</p>

<p>The bottom of the bass block model is shown in the image below:</p>
<img style="width:420px;padding-left:10px" src="images/bassBlock.jpg">
<p>As shown in the two previous images, the holes are aligned perpendicular to each other, allowing for copper tape to be applied through the holes and to create closed circuit through a resistor inside each block.</p>
